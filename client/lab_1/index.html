<h1> Ali Baloch Lab 1: Intro to HTML </h1>

<h2>First, the basics</h2>

<p>
I'll need the following to build my website.

<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>And other web development frameworks</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>My top five favorite albums are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Blonde by Frank Ocean</li>
    <li>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City by Kendrick Lamar</li>
    <li>Ctrl by SZA</li>
    <li>Ginger by BROCKHAMPTON</li>
    <li>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West</li>
</ol>
<p>

<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
</p>
<p>These albums aren't <em>necessarily</em> in perfect order.</p>
<p>The order actually changes multiple times a <strong>year.</strong></p>
<p>I'm just <em><strong>very indecisive.</strong></em></p>

<p><h3>Empty Elements</h3></p>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br/>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br/>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

<p><h2>Images</h2></p>

<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
